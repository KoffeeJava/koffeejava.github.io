I do not support AI imagry and companies that take data from the internet with out legal consent.


## The Problem
People are (obviously) worred about generative AI taking over creative industries (eg, animation, art, voice acting, etc) so they target AI as a whole.

## The Mistakes

### Thinking All AI is Gen AI
Ever Since the "AI Bloom" (around mid 2023) as I call it AI has been massively popularized and because of that when people think of AI they think of ChatGPT, Gemini, Veo 3, and other gen AI models instead  of things like social media algorithms and other uses. Because of this, people have generalized gen AI into all of AI.

### Thinking Gen AI Its Self is Stealing the Data its self
This is kinnda true but only is because it is the corporations making crawers (bots that go into random sites and take data) and uses the data to train their gen AI model aka steals images without licences to train their gen AI model.
