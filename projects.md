# Projects!

## [Tuxtility](https://github.com/KoffeeJava/Tuxtility)
Tuxtility is an extension for TurboWarp/TurboWarp based scratch mods that add a new dimension of web utilities.

## [WebCat](https://github.com/KoffeeJava/WebCat)
WebCat was made to take the new parts from Tuxtility that aren't in other extensions (as far as I know) and makes it into it's own extension!
You can see the list of blocks [here](/WebCat)

## [Wfetch](/wfetch)
An weather utility for your terminal!

## [KPAW](https://github.com/KoffeeJava/Koffees-PenguinMod-API-Wrapper)
Simple API wrapper for penguin mod.

## [koffeejava.github.io](https://github.com/KoffeeJava/koffeejava.github.io)
This website! I'm (hopefully) always working on this!
