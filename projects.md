# Projects!

## Tuxtility
Tuxtility is an extension for TurboWarp/TurboWarp based scratch mods that add a new dimension of web utilities. Get it [here!](https://github.com/KoffeeJava/Tuxtility)

## WebCat
WebCat was made to take the new parts from Tuxtility that aren't in other extensions (as far as I know) and makes it into it's own extension!
Get it at this [repo](https://github.com/KoffeeJava/WebCat) and out can see the list of blocks [here](/WebCat)

## [Wfetch](/wfetch)
An weather utility only for linux.
